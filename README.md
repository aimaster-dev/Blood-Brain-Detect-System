                                                      ABSTRACT
This  project  integrates  cutting-edge  computer  vision  techniques  used  to   enhance  the 
medical diagnostics by simultaneously addressing two critical aspects of healthcareâ€”blood 
sample analysis for leukemia and brain hemorrhage classification in MRI images. Leveraging
 the  YOLO  (You Only Look Once) algorithm, our system employs deep learning to efficiently 
detect and classify various stages of leukemia in blood samples. YOLO's real- time object detection 
capabilities enable swift identification of abnormal cells, facilitating early diagnosis and 
intervention. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset, ensuring robust performance across 
diverse cases.
 In parallel, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed for the intricate task of 
brain hemorrhage classification in MRI scans. The CNN model learns complex hierarchical features 
from brain images, enabling it to accurately differentiate between different types and stages of 
hemorrhages. This dual-faceted approach aims to provide a comprehensive diagnostic tool, 
facilitating healthcare professionals in timely and accurate decision-making. By combining the 
power of YOLO for  blood sample analysis and CNN for brain hemorrhage detection, this 
project endeavors to contribute to the advancement of medical diagnostics, ultimately improving 
patient outcomes and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.
